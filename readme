Hi. Here is the specification of the Life computer programming language.

I would like to work with many hackers around the world to help our community. It is starting, now.

The main goal behind the language is the idea to turn easy to program parallel and concurrent programs. It means: instead using an huge API to work with threads, just use a character to lunch a new thread of execution.

What???

Something like this:

- ! doHardWork1 # Parallel invocation of 'doHardWork1' method.
- ! doHardWork2 # Parallel invocation of 'doHardWork2' method.
v               # Wait for the termination of all above execution threads. After, continue running below steps.
- ! showEndOfProgram


Life is its name.

Enjoy it.

Peace out.
