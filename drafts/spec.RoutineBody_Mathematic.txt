	About formulae:
		The 'formulae:' is the section at the same line than '$' section.
		Formula's name starts with one dollar char and is composed by letters,
			numbers, and have no limit for length/size. The name is
			followed by one space, which is followed by : which is
			followed by equals char, which is followed by one space
			which is followed by one dollar char, which is followed
			by a symbolic name, which is followed by one space, which
			is followed by the equals char, which is followed by one
			space, which is followed by the equation.
		??? Functions are referenced only inside formulas at 'formulas:' section.
		Equation may refer a function invocation, a modulus operation, other arithmetic operations (add, sub, mul, div).
	About functions:
		The 'functions:' is the section after 'formulae:' section.
		Function's name starts with a letter and is composed by letters,
			numbers, and have no limit for length/size. The name is
			followed by one open-parenthese. The open-parenthese is
			followed by, at least, one argument. If there are more
			than one argument, those are separated by coma; The
			arguments is followed by a close-parenthese. The
			close-parenthese is followed by one space, which is
			followed by : which is followed by equals char, which is
			followed by one space which is followed by the equation.
		Functions are referenced only inside formulas at 'formulas:' section.
		TODO:functions operate only with numbers???
		TODO:functions body referes only to another functions or basic math???

Example:
		# ...
	$	formulae:
			$formula1 := $a = 4 + ($b + fnX(2, $c))
			$formula2 := $x = $a + |$b| - 3
		functions:
			# fn1() := 3	# Compiler will emit error. Functions have, at least, 1 argument.
			fn2($a,$b,$c) := $a + $b / $c
			fn3($a,$b,$c,$d) := ($a + $b) * $c
