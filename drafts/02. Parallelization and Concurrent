2 Parallelization and Concurrency
2.1 Forking
2.2 Joining
2.3 Example

2.1 Forking

The '-' character in the beginning of line instruction indicate to start an execution thread.
It is possible to give a name to the new thread, just following '-' with '(theThreadName)'.

2.2 Joining

The 'v' character in the beginning of line instruction indicate to wait for the completion of
all above started threads. Is is possible to use a list of thread names to wait for.

2.3 Example

# We do many tasks in parallel (inclusive the test of the if -- the ? character) and wait for completion of 2 named threads.
- ! doSomeHardWork_1
- (MyNamedThread1)
        v ! doSomeHardWork_2
        v + myThreadVar := 100
        v ! doSomeHardWork_3
- (MyNamedThread2)
        - ! doSomeHardWork_4
- ? varA = varB
        - (MyNamedThread3)
                - ! doSomeHardWork_5
v (MyNamedThread1, MyNamedThread3)
- showEndOfProgram

v @ {MyNamedThread1}.myThreadVar := 200
